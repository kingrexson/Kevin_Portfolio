## Projects
  For all at the Projects I tried all of them in all three Programming language SQL, R and Python. THe first reason for doing this is display how to perform simular concept, such as aggregation and jions in the three langauge. The second reason was to compare and contrast how I could use each of the tools to solve the same problem. Interesdt thing I found is each tool has it's strenght and weakness. For the visulazation Tablea was use to compare to GGplot and pythons tool.
