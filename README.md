## Projects
  For all at the Projects I tried all of them in all three Programming language SQL, R and Python. THe first reason for doing this is display how to perform simular concept, such as aggregation and jions in the three langauge. The second reason was to compare and contrast how I could use each of the tools to solve the same problem. Interest thing I found is each tool has it's strenght and weakness. For the visulazation Tablea was use to compare to GGplot and pythons tool. Below is a summarry of the projects for more detal on the individual mehtodlogy please check out the individual repositorys.   
  ## Project 1: BMT Loss
### Project Objective
The objective of this project is to find the BMT Loss rate of the GTEPs in Air Force Basic Military Training (BMT).  
### Project Background 
  Once Trainees are recruited they enter what is call Basic Military Training or BMT. Trainees can enter BMT with either a Gareentene Air Force Job or (GTEP) or as a open code. Open Trainees will be put in jobs in the later part of BMT and usually there to fill hard to fill positions. GTEP trainees are assigned a job or Air Force Special Code (AFSC) and will continue from BMT to the next step Techical Training if the past BMT. However, not everyone which a GTEP code trainee makes it pass BMT. This is consider a BMT loss. This can occur in three ways. They are release form there GTEP code, become a open and are reclassed into a new Job /AFSC. They are eliminated for BMT entirely or they change AFSC 
between the time the graduated BMT and start Technical Training.

### Methodoloy 
This project is might to report the number of trainee

  ## Project 2: Tech Training Reclass 
### Project Objective
The objective of this project is to find out which students Relass from and to specific AFSC.   
### Project Background 
  In most cases, when a trainee is elimination from there AFSC training (Job training), the Air Force will want to hold on the trainee if at all possible. They look at the trainees initail qualificationand see if the qualify for new Job or Air Force Speciaity Code (AFSC). This process is called an AFSC Reeclassification.   he may be reclassed into Air 
between the time the graduated BMT and start Technical Training.
